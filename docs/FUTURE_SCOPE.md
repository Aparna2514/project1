Project: Supply Chain Management System (B2C Model)
This project lays the groundwork for a scalable supply chain management system. Currently file-based and terminal-driven, the system can be significantly enhanced in the following ways:

1. Database Integration (SQL/NoSQL)
Replace file-based storage with a robust database system such as:
‚úÖ MySQL / PostgreSQL for relational data
‚úÖ MongoDB for flexible document-based storage

Benefits:
Faster querying
Better data integrity
Scalable storage
Support for concurrent access

2. Interactive Frontend (IPT / GUI)
Replace command-line interface with a more intuitive UI:
‚úÖ IPT (Internet Programming Techniques) with:
HTML/CSS + JavaScript
Backend in PHP or Node.js
‚úÖ GUI Desktop App using:
Qt (for C++)

Features to include:
Drag-and-drop inventory control
Real-time stock visualization
Order tracking dashboard

3.  Data Analysis & Visualization
Use Python + Pandas/Matplotlib/Plotly to analyze:
Sales trends
Inventory health
Product demand forecasting
Generate interactive dashboards for admins
Export reports in Excel/PDF

4. Machine Learning Integration
Build intelligent systems for:
üß† Sales Forecasting using time-series analysis
üîÑ Auto-Replenishment Models to predict when stock will run low
üéØ Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis
Recommend products
Personalized discounts
Tools:
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (for advanced models)

5. Mobile Application
Cross-platform mobile app using:
Flutter / React Native
Kotlin (Android Native)

Enable:
On-the-go order placing
Notifications for stock alerts or offers
Customer support chat integration

6. Cloud Deployment
Host the system on:
AWS / Azure / Google Cloud
Benefits:
Real-time access from anywhere
Scalable resources
Secure backups and disaster recovery

7. Authentication & Role Management
Add secure login for:
Admins
Warehouse staff
Customers
Role-based permissions to:
Prevent unauthorized access
Protect sensitive data

8. Integration with ERP & Logistics APIs
Connect with:
ERP systems for real-time stock updates
Logistics services (e.g., Delhivery, Shiprocket) for:
Live delivery tracking
Automatic shipping label generation

üõ†Ô∏è 9. Unit Testing and CI/CD
Add test coverage using:
GoogleTest (for C++)
PyTest (if ported to Python)
Integrate with GitHub Actions for:
Auto-builds
Linting
Test feedback on every push

üìÖ 10. Multi-Vendor B2B/B2C Support
Upgrade from single-company B2C to:
Multi-vendor marketplace model
Vendor dashboards
Inter-company supply chain simulation
